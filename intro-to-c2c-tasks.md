# kidoko-couch-to-coder-python

This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of Bright Network's Couch to Coder: Python programme, which mainly focused on data analytics and visualisation. Here's a quick overview of each one:

## control_flow_atm.py
This code is meant to mimic an ATM, where a customer enters the correct PIN to view their balance. They can deposit or withdraw cash, and the code will present the new balance.

## long_rivers.py
This task helped me to understand dictionaries and how they work.

## pin_number_2.0.py
An updated version of "control_flow_atm.py" that gives the customer three attempts to enter the correct PIN before locking their account.

## employee_data.py
This task makes use of dictionaries, lists, if/else statements and for loops to extract information from an employee database.

## uk_volkwagen.py
This code analyses and visualises data from a database of Volkswagen vehicles purchased in the UK between 2000 and 2020.

## pie_bar_ext
Contains the bar and pie charts created for the extension tasks in "uk_volkswagen.py".
